Dear Sir,

Re: Application for an Internship

I am writing to apply for an internship in the ICT Department within the institution.  As a soon-to-be graduate, I possess many 
technical skills that I believe will come in handy in my stay/for the department.

I am a Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology undergraduate at the Technical University of Mombasa, having completed my studies and awaiting graduation at the end of the year. During my free time, I have been improving my skills in software development and design, and I feel that it is time I put them to good use.

I previously held my industrial attachment at ABC Bank, Westlands, where I did something, learnt something.... This could be of interest to you, as I recently read on your website that ....(related to what I learnt). I believe that I will learn a lot from the experience, while also helping you achieve your (specific goals) as an institution.

a university of global excellence in Training, Research and Innovation for Development. 

I appreciate the opportunity to discuss available positions and provide further information. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Victor Machira.
