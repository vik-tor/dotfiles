VS COde

nstead of Ctrl+V: Select multiple lines and then Alt+Shift+I, it will put a cursor in each line, then you can do anything to all lines at once.

Select text and then Ctrl+Shift+L - puts a cursor everywhere your selection is found. Ctrl+D does the same but adds one cursor at a time, if you only want the first two for example.

Instead of Ctrl+O/Ctrl+I: Alt+Left/Alt+Right

Instead of f/F/t/T: Select until pattern - Visual Studio Marketplace or Select By - Visual Studio Marketplace

There are commands for gu/gU but they are not bounded by default, but also change-case - Visual Studio Marketplace

Instead of viw/vi"/vi( - Alt+Shift+Right
